# ML-UED
Machine Learning scripts for analyzing and planning Ultrafast Electron Diffraction experiments


The repo contains two folders `CNN`, which contains code to classify UED patterns from MoTe2 crystals into different crystal structures and `VAE` which uses latent space agebra to identify if a given UED pattern represents a phase transformation between the 2H and 1T polytypes of MoTe2
